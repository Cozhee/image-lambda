## DESCRIPTION

Wish I knew honestly because its and I am still lost in the sauce.


## PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED

Have zero idea how to actually use pubObject in aws. Somehow I was only able to get it to write to the images.json file when I would delete it and then reupload the images.json file. When I would upload an image nothing at all would happen. Ever. That was the main issue I have been stuck on the last 15 hours.
